Fine-tuning Diffusion Model with LoRA on MNIST Dataset

This notebook will attempt to implement Fine-tuning of the Diffusion Model with Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)  from scratch on the MNIST dataset using Pytorch.

1. Build a CNN with linear layers. Train this model to perform on MNIST 0-4 (the first half of the data).
2. Use the standard finetuning approach to train this model to work on MNIST 5-9 (the second half of the data). 
3. Use LoRA finetuning to train the original model to work on MNIST 5-9 (the second half of the data).
